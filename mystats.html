 <h2>Paneer Butter Masala</h2>
 <p>Paneer is a good source of protein, especially for vegetarians. It contains all nine essential amino acids that are required for the proper functioning of the body. Furthermore, compared to other cheese it is a healthier option and can be consumed regularly. Paneer Butter Masala curry is delicious because of its taste and texture. I like Paneer Butter Masala as it is very healthy and also very delicious.</p>
